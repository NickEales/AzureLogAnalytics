# AzureLogAnalytics

This is my collection of Azure Log Analytics (often called "OMS") queries that I use.

For perf queries, my aim is to:

1. only show the interesting instances
2. show the full graph for any given instance (not just the samples that exceed tolerance)

Since my work is usually focused on Microsoft virtualization technologies, (Azure & Hyper-V / VMM), these examples are focused on them.
